# Experimental Web Page
The main purpose of designing this website is to facilitate my research experiments. It utilizes APIs for Bluetooth connectivity, projection, and includes a small backend database for data storage. The Bluetooth device connected is a self-made sensor, and the backend database is used to store experimental data for later retrieval and analysis.

Due to the self-made sensor of the Bluetooth device and the database being set up on the experimental computer, it is not feasible to demonstrate.
